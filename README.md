# Static Portfolio Website built with Jekyll

I am using this theme personally for my portfolio website.

This Theme features:

- Sweet Scroll
- BrowserSync
- Font Awesome and Devicon icons
- Google Analytics

## Setup

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): `sudo gem install bundler jekyll`
2. Clone the particle theme: `git clone https://github.com/longpdo/jekyll-theme-particle-orb.git`
3. Install dependencies
4. Run: `jekyll serve`

## Personalize and customize
1. Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site.
2. Edit files inside `_data` to add information to the portfolio.
3. Edit `_particle-orb.scss` to customize the particle orb animation.
